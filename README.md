# To_do_app_django_project
"A Django-based to-do app that helps me better understand CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and user authentication. The app includes features for user registration, login, and logout, along with the ability to create, update, and delete tasks. This project helped me deepen my knowledge of Django and build practical skills for handling user data and task management."
